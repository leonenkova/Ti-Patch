# Ti-Patch
This repository implements the paper "Ti-Patch: Tiled Physical Adversarial Patch for no-reference video quality metrics" [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09961)]

## Datasets
For training, we selected 1000 256x256 images from the COCO dataset. 
Validation was performed using 250 256x256 images from the COCO.

## Model
We attacked [PaQ-2-PiQ](https://github.com/baidut/paq2piq) NR image quality metric. 

## Code
To generate the Ti-Patch use the following [code](https://github.com/leonenkova/Ti-Patch/blob/main/Ti_Patch_Attack_Training.ipynb).
